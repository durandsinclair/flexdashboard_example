# The purpose of this file is to explain where to find the output directory.
# RMarkdown files are converted to HTML files. This is RMarkdown's output. 
# The output_dir is where you want RMarkdown to store those outputs.
# As it happens, github reads HTML files from a "docs" directory, which is 
# why we've specified that this is where our HTML outputs should be placed
